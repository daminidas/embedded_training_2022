      There are two basic types of memory:

                        1)Primary/main memory
                        2)External/secondary memory


        Primary Memory
                       Random Access Memory(RAM)
                                  Static RAM (SRAM)
                                  Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

                              Most modern computers and phones have from 2GB up to 32GB of RAM. 
                               In laptops, it's common to have 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB.


                       Read-Only memory(ROM)
                                  MROM
                                  PROM
                                  EPROM - Erasable programmable read-only memory
                                  EEPROM - Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM
                          
                                Most smartphones nowadays have ROM ranging from 8GB to 256GB and more.
                         
                          
      Secondary Memory
                      1)Hard disk drives (HDD)
                          The capacity can be anywhere from 250GB to 20TB. 
                           The standard capacity for most users is 500GB.

                       2)Solid-state drive (SSD)
                                SSDs for computers are available from 120GB up to 30.72TB capacities.

                       3)Optical discs
                                 CD-ROM - Compact Disc Read-Only Memory
                                 CD-R - Compact Disc-Recordable
                                 CD-RW - Compact Disk Re-Writable

                                     CDs were co-created by Sony and Philips and were first manufactured in August 1982 can                                      store up to 700MB of data.
                                     DVDs were invented in 1995. The largest capacity of the DVD is 17.04GB.
                                     Blu-ray discs can store up to 50GB of data.

                      4)USB Flash Drive(2TB)

                      5)SD Card(8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB and 128GB)

                      6)Magnetic Tape(Maximum capacity of currently available magnetic tape is 10TB.)


                   INTERFACES
                  

                    i. Onboard communication interface - Used for internal communication in systems
                               [ I2C,SPI,UART,CAN AND Parallel Bus interfaces ]
                    ii. External communication interface- communicate with external world
                               [USB, BLUETOOTH, WiFi, ZigBee, RS-232C&amp; RS-485, IEEE1394 firewire ]
